/**
 * What **Move stack onto the remote** does to the layers.
 *
 * The fixture builds the state that GitHub leaves behind once a stacked pull request merges. A
 * teammate's clone substitutes for GitHub: the clone advances trunk, replays every layer onto it,
 * and force-pushes all three. The work repository then still points at the pre-rebase commits, and
 * holds nothing of its own.
 *
 * Most of these tests check a refusal, as `pull.test.mjs` does. The move replaces local commits
 * outright, so each refusal test asserts that no layer moved, rather than only that the call threw.
