/**
 * adoptRemote — move each layer of a stack onto the commit that its remote already holds.
 *
 * GitHub restacks a stack whenever one of its pull requests merges: GitHub retargets the new bottom
 * pull request at the trunk, then force-pushes every remaining branch onto the squash commit. A
 * checkout that has only fetched since that restack still points at the pre-rebase commits, so
 * `syncBadge` marks every layer diverged even though the remote holds the commits that the pull
 * requests name. A local rebase reaches those same trees under new shas, and `gh stack push` then
 * force-pushes all of them, which restarts each check and marks the review comments outdated.
 * `adoptRemoteStack` takes the remote's commits instead, and pushes nothing.
 *
 * Two refusals make the action safe to run. `--cherry-pick` drops every local commit whose patch is
 * already on the remote, so each commit that survives the filter exists nowhere else.
 * `^<trunk>` drops trunk's own commits as well. A layer that a local rebase moved onto a newer
 * trunk carries those commits, and they belong to trunk rather than to the layer. Without that
 * exclusion, the check refuses the half-finished restack that this module repairs. The second
 * refusal compares the commit messages, because a reword leaves the patch identical and
 * `--cherry-pick` matches on the patch alone.
 *
 * One `update-ref --stdin` batch moves every layer, and each update names the sha that the
 * preceding ref read returned, so `update-ref` refuses the whole batch when a branch has moved
 * since then. The checked-out
 * layer stays out of that batch: its working copy has to move with the branch, so `git reset` moves
 * that layer on its own. The undo checkpoint that the caller takes covers both writes.
