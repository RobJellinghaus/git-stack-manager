/**
 * pruneMerged — delete the local branches whose pull request merged, and say why the rest stay.
 *
 * A squash or rebase merge lands new commits on trunk, so the branch that was merged keeps
 * its own and goes on drawing a row with a merged badge until someone deletes it. Deleting
 * the branch is what takes those commits out of the tree: they stay in the object store,
 * reachable from the reflog, and Undo recreates the branch.
 *
 * The proof that a branch holds nothing new is that its tip is the exact commit GitHub
 * reports as the pull request's head. A branch amended after the merge, or one that gained
 * a commit, points elsewhere and is kept — deleting it would lose the only copy of that work.
 * The check runs twice: once against the snapshot, and again inside the deletion itself,
 * because `update-ref` refuses to delete a ref whose value is not the one it was given.
 *
 * Every branch it keeps carries the reason, because a merged badge next to a branch that
 * stays otherwise reads as a broken setting. The reason is written once here and shown
 * wherever the reader asks: the top bar's *Clear merged* tooltip, and the toast that button
 * leaves behind.

 * Naming the branches is what lets the automatic path skip one Undo brought back: it asks for
 * the branches it has not asked for before, so a branch restored by hand is not deleted again
 * when the next pull request merges. Passing null takes every branch that qualifies, which is
 * what *Clear merged* asks for. A requested branch that no longer qualifies is skipped, not
 * refused: the rule is the host's, and the request may predate a commit on it.
 *
 * One `update-ref --stdin` batch in the ordinary case, and one call per branch only after that
 * batch is refused. The batch used to be the whole story, which meant a single branch committed
 * to between the read and the delete kept every other branch in the batch — and the webview had
 * already recorded them all as asked for, so they were never offered again. Retrying one by one
 * costs an extra process per branch on a path that runs almost never, and keeps the refusal to
 * the branch that earned it.
 *
 * Each deleted branch's `branch.<name>` config goes too, as `git branch -D` would remove it:
 * left behind, a branch later created under the same name silently inherits the old upstream.
