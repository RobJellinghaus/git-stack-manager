/**
 * Delete merged branches as they appear, while the Config drawer says to.
 *
 * The host decides which branches qualify and lists them on the model; this hook only asks,
 * and only for the ones the host reports as deletable. Each branch is asked for once at each
 * commit, and that memory is stored, so it holds across reloads: a branch the host then keeps
 * is not asked for again on every poll, and a branch Undo brought back stays, because the
 * reader who pressed Undo wanted it. Turning the setting off clears that memory; the top bar's
 * *Clear merged* ignores it outright, which is the other way to ask a second time.
 *
 * The memory is written when the request answers, not before it. Written first, a request that
 * failed left every branch in it remembered and therefore never retried — the branch stayed in
 * the tree, and turning the setting off and on again was the only way back.
 *
 * "As they appear" runs only as fast as the host learns: two reads bring pull request status in,
 * one per load and one on *Refresh PRs*, so a merge that lands while this view stands open reaches
 * the model at the next of those rather than within seconds.
 *
 * An effect, because the trigger is a model arriving from the host rather than a click.
