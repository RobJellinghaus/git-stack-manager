/**
 * What the toast reports after a stack moves onto its remote.
 *
 * The toast takes one of three shapes:
 *
 *   - some layers moved,
 *   - every layer already matched its remote,
 *   - no layer had a remote commit to move onto.
 *
 * The host supplies the reason that a layer stayed behind, so one place owns that wording rather
 * than each surface owning a copy.
 *
 * This module leaves out the stale-record warning. `staleStackNote` belongs to every surface that
 * moves a layer, and the caller appends it exactly as the rebase toast does.
